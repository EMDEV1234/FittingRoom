        <p>
          Online fashion is booming, but behind the screen lies a costly,
          unsustainable problem: returns. In the U.S. alone, 2.6 million tonnes
          of returned clothing ended up in landfills in 2020, and returns
          created 16 million tonnes of COâ‚‚ emissionsâ€”the equivalent of 3.5
          million cars on the road for a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why? Because online shopping doesn't let you try things on. Poor fit
          and size guesswork account for 70% of fashion returns, and that's not
          just frustratingâ€”it's expensive. The fashion industry faces a $218
          billion return crisis, with 24.4% of apparel orders returned and $38
          billion lost in returns in the U.S. in 2023 alone.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.boldText}>Fitting Room exists to fix that.</p>
        <p>
          We give shoppers the ability to try on clothes virtually before
          purchasingâ€”so they can buy with confidence, not uncertainty. Powered
          by advanced AI, our app lets users upload a photo, select garments,
          and see a realistic preview of how they'll look and fit on their
          unique body. No more guesswork. No more cart anxiety. No more
          avoidable returns.
